# Bachelor Thesis: Pascal Dominic Müller

The goal of this thesis was to explore the space of gravitational wave analysis using deep learning approaches. At the time of writing this thesis, a [machine learning challenge](https://github.com/gwastro/ml-mock-data-challenge-1/tree/a726f8aecf96c9794178b16ea659956858a8d864) was being held by the Albert-Einstein-Institut Hannover and the Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena with the goal of capturing the state of the art and finding new useful approaches. This thesis makes heavy use of the material provided by this challenge.

# Folders
